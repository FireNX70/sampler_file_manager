Linux
	Dependencies
		1. A toolchain. I've been using GCC 14. Clang 21 won't work, because it
		   lacks std::chrono::clock_cast.
		2. CMake.
		3. Make.
		4. Qt6.

		On Debian, this can be installed with
		"apt-get install gcc cmake qt6-base-dev".

	Building
		From the project's root run:
			cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -B build
			cd build
			make -j $(nproc)

Windows
	Use MSYS2 https://www.msys2.org/. Specifically, MSYS2 MINGW64. You'll need a
	version that's not too old. I tested one from July 2024 that would fail to
	handle symlinks.

	Cloning
		When cloning, you should use git clone's -c option and set the
		core.symlinks variable to true (git clone -c core.symlinks=true).

	Dependencies
		1. A toolchain. I've been using GCC.
		2. CMake.
		3. Ninja.
		4. Qt6.
		5. Qt6 tools.

		On MSYS2, this can be installed with
		"pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,cmake,qt6-base,qt6-tools}"

	Building
		For the first step (cmake), you may get an error about symlinks
		(depending on your Windows, MSYS2 and git settings).
		If you encounter that error; running MSYS2 as admin, as much as I
		dislike that option, gets rid of that. A better option might be to
		enable Windows' Developer mode.

		The last step will also print a bunch of errors, but you can ignore
		those.

		From the project's root run:
			cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -B build
			cd build
			ninja
			cd ..
			./copy_msys_dlls.sh
