Linux
	Dependencies
		1. A toolchain. I've been using GCC, Clang should work but I haven't
		   tested.
		2. CMake.
		3. Make.
		4. Qt6.

		On Debian, this can be installed with
		"apt-get install gcc cmake qt6-base-dev".

	Building
		From the project's root run:
			cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -B build
			cd build
			make -j $(nproc)

Windows
	Use MSYS2 https://www.msys2.org/. Specifically, MSYS2 MINGW64.

	Dependencies
		1. A toolchain. I've been using GCC.
		2. CMake.
		3. Ninja.
		4. Qt6.
		5. Qt6 tools.

		On MSYS2, this can be installed with
		"pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,cmake,qt6-base,qt6-tools}"

	Building
		For the first step (cmake), you'll likely get an error about symlinks.
		Running MSYS2 as admin, as much as I dislike that option, gets rid of
		that.

		The last step will also print a bunch of errors, but you can ignore
		those.

		From the project's root run:
			cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -B build
			cd build
			ninja
			cd ..
			./copy_msys_dlls.sh
